every ant represent a node in a network at first the colony enlists a list of nodes 

every node chooses what to send depending on its activity 


at a moment a node sends a message to another one 
the controller records the message into the edges of the decision graph 

the ant calculate the new parameters of the edges  based on phermone inspired formulaes



On the arrival of a new message the algorithm works as follow : 
	1- Apply a heuristic value to the decision if the heuristic takes us to the colony 
	2- Verify if the ants Colony can decide whether or not to the SourceNode is trustworthy
	3- If the ants colony can not decide use machine learning to decide begnin or ddos traffic 
	4- Update the colony based on the result of the machine learning prediction
